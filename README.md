Hey everyone! Welcome to my makeovermonday repository.

Here you will find my makeovermonday submissions. You will find basically two different types of files : Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) and .jpg or .png screenshot from my submission.
I mainly use Tableau Public for my submission, and they will be classified in folders, following the logic YYYY_weeknumber.

For therecord, here is a complete description of what are the Make Over Monday :-) . This description is directly drawn from the original website http://makeovermonday.co.uk/ .

Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart. Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake.

Each week’s topic will be posted on the data sets page on Sunday. It will include the link to the original article (for context) and to the data set. We welcome one and all to participate, but be mindful of a few things:

1. This is not about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and the story.
2. The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Makeover Monday is designed to help you practice data visualization.
3. Use the hashtag #MakeoverMonday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.
4. Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.
5. Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things don’t work, and how you made it better.
6. Consider time-boxing yourself to one hour. Just make something quick.
7. The purpose of the makeover is to improve on the original visualisation. You should try stick to the fields in the data set provided and improve upon the original visualisation. However, if supplementing the data helps you tell a better story, go for it!
8. Give credit to the original data source whenever possible
